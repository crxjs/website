This project is the new documentation for CRXJS and is still in its early stages. We'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions â€” feel free to open a pull request anytime!

This documentation is built based on `shadcn-docs-nuxt` . Please check out the shadcn-docs-nuxt [`documentation`](https://shadcn-docs-nuxt.vercel.app/) for more information.

- [x] Create a tutorial on integrating CRXJS from scratch (without using `create-crxjs`)
- [ ] Add tutorial GIFs demonstrating browser extension loading(content/loading.md)
- [x] Develop a guide for bundling extensions(content/packaging.md)
- [x] Update the `shadcn-docs` to [v1](https://shadcn-docs-nuxt.vercel.app/blog/v1)

- [x] support AI , add `llm.txt`
- [ ] Create an `awesome-crx` showcase in the CRXJS repository to feature extensions built with CRXJS, and display it on the documentation (inspired by [awesome-vite](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite))
